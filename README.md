🔋 EV Battery Cell Management System
📖 Overview

The EV Battery Cell Management System is an interactive Streamlit-based simulator that models the behavior of different battery cells such as LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) and NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt).

It allows users to:

Generate virtual cells with randomized parameters

Monitor cell statistics like voltage, temperature, and capacitance

Visualize distributions and trends using Altair charts

Export simulated data for further analysis

This tool is ideal for:

Students & researchers studying Battery Management Systems (BMS)

Simulation of EV batteries for prototyping

Educational demonstrations of cell variations

⚙️ Features

✅ Simulate different battery chemistries (LFP & NMC)

✅ Randomized values for voltage, current, capacitance, and temperature

✅ Real-time visualization with interactive charts

✅ Summary statistics of generated cells

✅ Export results as CSV for external analysis

✅ Clean UI with Streamlit

🚀 Installation & Usage
